Notes from Farid on Apr 27, 2017 about his tandem airfoil experiments


Hi Isaac,

Thanks, and I hope everything is fine with you too. Here are the lift and drag data for the single and tandem airfoils. Below is how these data are arranged in the variables.
Regarding the actual flow fields, I have PIV data only for 20 cases indicated in Fig. 5 of my thesis. If you need any of those, please let me know, and I can send them to you.

LD_single.mat contains three variables lift and drag, both having the size 15x7, and aoa having the size 1x15. The size of the matrices correspond to 15 angles of attack -10:5:60, and 7 Reynolds numbers 3000:2000:15000. The data is arranged in the ascending order, so that for instance, lift(12,5) is the lift coefficient at alpha = 45 deg and Re = 11000.
The tandem experiments were done with two sets of combinations of upstream and downstream angles-of-attack: In the first set, the upstream angle-of-attack was kept fixed at 30 deg while the downstream angle-of-attack varied with alpha_d = 0, 20, 40, 60 deg; and in the second set, the upstream angle-of-attack varied with alpha_u = 0, 20, 40, 60 deg while the downstream angle-of-attack was kept fixed at 30 deg. For each combination of angles-of-attack, 6x4 combinations of horizontal gap and vertical stagger was considered: gap = 2, 4, 6, 8 chord lengths, and stagger = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 chord lengths.
LD_tandem.mat contains eight variables containing the data for the lift and drag coefficients of the upstream and downstream airfoils measured with the first or second set of the angles-of-attack combination. Each variable has the size 6x4x4, with the first two indices respectively corresponding to the gap and stagger, and the third index corresponding to angle-of-attack of the varying airfoil. The data is arranged in the ascending order, so that for instance, lift_u_1(3,2,4) is the lift coefficient of the upstream airfoil with gap = 6 c, stagger = 1 c, alpha_u = 30 deg, and alpha_d = 60 deg; also, drag_d_2(2,4,1) is the drag coefficient of the downstream airfoil with gap = 4 c, stagger = 3 c, alpha_u = 0 deg, and alpha_d = 30 deg.
Please let me know if anything remains unclear.
